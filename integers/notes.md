# Integers with TDD

1.	Write a test to call a function which adds two numbers.
1.	Test the program by using go test command, we will get compilation error, as we have not written function to add two numbers.
1.	Write a function which adds two numbers and return 0 from function
1.	Again run go test, now test will fail as it returns the sum as 0
1.	Refactor the code to return proper result of sum.
1.	Now test the code again, and we are good to see the test has passed.
